# spellcraft
Spellcraft is a Minecraft mod inspired, in no particular order, by Ars Magica, Thaumcraft, and Industrialcraft. 
It adds the ability to create custom spells from spell Shapes, Effects, and Modifiers. Like Botania, Spellcraft
aspires to be a tech mod dressed up in a veneer of magic.
## Mechanics
### Spells
Apart from combat uses like hurling fireballs, lightning bolts, and summoning blizzard clowds, spells may be 
cast by machines, providing enormous industrial opportunities: there are spells that accelerate the growth of 
crops and trees and spells that harvest them; spells that melt stone into lava and spells that crystallise
lava into minerals; spells that breed animals and spells that slaughter them and cook their drops.
### Runes
Spellcraft adds Rune Slots to tools and armor. Each piece of equipment has a number of Rune Slots
proportional to its enchantability. Runes are magical integrated circuits which can cast a certain spell at
no cost, with a cooldown proportional to the spell's Mana cost. Runes on tools are activated by right-clicking
the tool, and those on armor are activated when the wearer is hit.
### Mana
Mana is the resource used by players, mobs, and machines alike to cast spells. Its initial sources are
Mana Crystals and Mana Crystal Ores found underground and Lunarci, which slowly generate Mana Crystals
from magical particles present in the moon's rays. Both Mana Crystals and Lunarci are highly explosive,
and trampling either of them causes a violent release of the magical energy they contain in the form of
random damaging spells. The Arcane Catalyst releases the Mana bound in Mana Crystals in an orderly manner
to fuel your spell-casting machines. The Arcane Reactor is far more efficient at converting Mana Crystals
into Mana, but requires careful design to avoid the risk of a magical meltdown releasing arcane storms.

Later on in the game, Mana can be fully automated. Lunarci can be magically mutated into Moonflowers,
sentient artificial plants capable of producing much greater amounts of Mana Crystals. Bees can be
magically transformed into Spellstingers, aggressive creatures with Mana Crystal stingers that consume
flowers in exchange for Mana.
## Ores & Materials
Spellcraft adds the raw materials of Bismuth, Silver, and Lead, and the alloys of Electrum and
Soulforged steel. Bismuth crystals serve as a wonderful magical semiconductors, along with Electrum, a
strong magical conductor, in the manufacturing of runes - magical integrated circuits. Lead is a very
powerful magical insulator, with thin lead plates fully blocking even high-energy magical radiation.
This makes lead useful as defence against mages and in the construction of Arcane Reactors.
Soulforged Steel is the material that Spawners are made of, and enables the construction of Arcane
Spawners.
